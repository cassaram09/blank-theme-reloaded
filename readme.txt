                        Blank Theme Reloaded
                        --------------------
               (aka Blank Theme 2: Electric Boogaloo)

This is Chris Coyiers "Blank" theme ported to WordPress 4.4 and updated
for 2016 by Lewis Collard and Steve Judge. From the original description:

 It is a WordPress theme with all the functionality of a typical WordPress
 theme but almost none of the styling. The idea is that when starting a new
 theme, it is far easier to use this as a base then a theme that is already
 finished and styled.

This is a raw ingot, a blank for use in new theme development; this is of
no interest to non-developers.

Other than fixing it to work with modern WordPress versions, we did the
following:

 * Updated jQuery.
 * Fixed use of deprecated functions; it now works without warnings on 4.4
   with WP_DEBUG turned on.
 * Added a Meyer CSS reset.
 * Boilerplate blah in style.css to make theme-check happy.
 * Media queries, albeit blank ones, that work for me.
 * Uses HTML5 tags where appropriate.
 * A couple of default styles and default JavaScript that are common across
   all my sites.
